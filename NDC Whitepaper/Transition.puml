title Implementation: From Problem to Solution

package "Current State" {
  [Opaque NDC Offers] as Current
  note bottom : Look-to-book 1000:1\nMassive "fishing"
}

package "Phase 1: Standards" {
  [IATA Product Exchange] as P1
}

package "Phase 2: Retailer Intelligence" {
  [Product Knowledge Base] as P2
}

package "Phase 3: Smart Shopping" {
  [Targeted Requests Only] as P3
  note bottom : Look-to-book 50:1\n80% fewer API calls
}

Current -> P1 : Adopt IATA standards
P1 -> P2 : Build product intelligence
P2 -> P3 : Enable smart shopping

note right : Key Advantage:\nNo central platform\nBilateral implementation
